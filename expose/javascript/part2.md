Question 13
Arithmetic
‘3’ + 2             32
‘3’ - 2             1
3 + null            3
‘3’ + null          null
true + 3            4
false + null        0
'3' + undefined     '3undefined'
'3' - undefined     NaN

Question 14
Comparison
‘2’ > 1             true
‘2’ < ‘12’          false
2 == ‘2’            true
2 === ‘2’           false
true == 2           false
true === Boolean(2)         true

Question 15
Explain the difference between the == and === operators
A regular equality check == has a problem. It cannot differentiate 0 from false
A strict equality operator === checks the equality without type conversion.

Question 17
the result will be [2,4,6]
Here we are passing in the function doSomething as a parameter,
first we created a new array of constants,
we iterate through the given array and call doSomething
on each element, then push the result in the array we created.
then we return the array we created.
